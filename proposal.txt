In the final project, I will focus on assessment of listening skills, which is what I worked on my master thesis. In my thesis, I collected data from students watched a video on TedEd.com., which was basically the listening portion of the study, and then summarized the content orally. Each student recorded their summaries and I rated those summaries based on students’ ability to understand the main ideas and details. I ignored the linguistic features since I was interested in students’ listening skills, not speaking skills. In the program that I will develop, I aim to rate students’ summaries. However, considering my knowledge and abilities in developing a program, I will transcribe students’ oral summaries and rate written texts rather than oral summaries.  I will create a list of details only (I will ignore the main idea in the program) that are mentioned in the video, which will serve as the objects of my program. Once I enter the data to the program, which are students’ transcribed summaries, I will expect my program to tell me how many of the details students’ summary have. I expect students to use similar or same vocabulary with the original video since it is a recount(retelling) task, which will help the program to be reliable as much as possible. Below is a rough version of my data (variables, or objects, I am not sure how to name them):  
Video: Superstitions
Target Details: Number 17, Number 13, Knocking on the wood, last supper, home to spirits, dead in Roman numeral numbers, 
 An excerpt from a student’s summary: [00:00:08] Like uh. SHE'S SHE'S UH SHE'S SURE UH SHE TALKED ABOUT HOW. How do you react with number 13 and a black cat and something like that. Then she talked about. Superstitions and what people think are what. Like 13 and uh black. Uh first sir two it was uh. Like a pet. Uh. No. Which. Which people say it's bad luck. [00:00:48][40.1]
